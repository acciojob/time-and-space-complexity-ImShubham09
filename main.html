	<h1>>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm changes with the size of the input. It helps determine how efficient an algorithm is for different input sizes.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to its input size. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses memory proportional to the size of the input.</p>
